            Integration of Princely States

            After<b>independence in 1947, India</b> had more than 560 princely states. As India’s first Deputy Prime

            and Home Minister, Patel successfully united these states into one nation using diplomacy, persuasion, and
            firmness.
            Because of this great achievement, he is called the “Iron Man of India.”
